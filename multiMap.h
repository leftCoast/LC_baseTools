// multiMap..
//
// Sometimes your data doesn't actually fit very well on a straight line. Its..
// Non-linier. multiMap is a really fast and easy way to get "good enough" data fitting to
// a non-linier data set.
//
// Theory :
// Image you have a data set that is not a line, but kinda' a bow shape. Mapping
// from endpoint to endpoint is fine near the endpoints, but in the middle? The error is
// just too great. What you do is locate, as well as possible, the point of the largest
// error. At that point, calculate the actual correct answer. (X,Y) Now, adding that
// point into your function, breaks your data fitting into two lines. This should fit
// "better" together than your one line before. If you still have places that have too
// large of an error, repeat the process 'till the multiple line segments all fit "good
// enough". To your curve.
//
// And how to achieve this here?
// Start by creating an empty multiMap object. In fact that's all you can start with. Now
// add the end points using : addPoint(X,Y); Where x is your "inputted reading" and y is
// what it should map to. Now you have a linier mapper. Need to add more points to fit it
// better to the curve? Easy! Calcualte the points you need and add them the same way
// using addPoint(X,Y); Doesn't matter what order you add points. The code will sort them
// out for you. Once you have added enough points to make a good enough fit. You can use
// the map() method to map your results from your inputeded data.

// mapPoint : You don't interact with this object. Its used by multiMap. If you mess with
// it, it'll probably just bite you. And no one's going to say they're sorry.

// multiMap : This is the one you should be using. You can create multiMaps. Add points to
// them. Clear points from them. Map stuff using them and, actually.. Integrate curves
// using them. Its basically a list of mappers and a mapper can actually do integration so
// it was tossed in. Very handy for calculating things like trapezoidal moves on the fly.
